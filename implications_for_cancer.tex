\section{Implications for cancer signature analysis}

Motivation: uncertainty in signature assignment and definition


\subsection{Methods and resources}

\subsubsection{Data sources and acquisition}

Individual studies, TCGA, ICGC, PCAWG

Filtering and QC

\subsubsection{Analysing DNA repair efficacy}

Sample labeling: search for signs of defective repair components

\subsubsection{Methods for extraction of signature alterations}

\subsubsection*{MCMC for effect extraction}

\subsubsection*{Expanded model for simultaneous exposure, signature and effect extraction}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Analysis of publicly available data}

\subsubsection{Clinically targetable interactions}

Interactions as a source of therapy targets: temozolomide and MGMT, BRCA and PARP inhibitors, APOBEC and ATR inhibitors

\subsubsection{Significance of DNA repair genes}


\subsubsection{Interactions of DNA repair and damage factors detectable in human cancers}

Interactions observed in human data

Illustration:

\subsubsection*{temozolomide}

\subsubsection*{APOBEC and BER}

\subsubsection*{POLE-MMR}

\subsubsection*{NER/FA and cisplatin}

Prospective interactions which are not represented in the data yet

Signature 17 may be a result of mutagenic activity and interact with NER status

Other environmental agents (asbestos, alcohol?)
