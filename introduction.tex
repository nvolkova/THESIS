\chapter{Introduction}

Genome stability maintenance plays the key role in cellâ€™s ability to propagate. Spontaneous 
changes and mutagenic damage in the genome may cause wide range of diseases including cancer. 
These alterations can be an effect of combination of environmental factors damaging DNA and 
deficiencies in DNA repair and replication leading to characteristic mutational spectra.

Various mutational process attack the genome due to endogenous or exogenous factors, and 
many of them are believed to leave a unique pattern of mutations in the genome. Given the 
explosion in the amount of publicly available cancer sequencing data, it was tempting to 
aggregate it together and apply machine learning methods to extract the signatures of 
underlying mutagenic processes. Hence, mutational signatures (\cite{Alexandrov2013-md}, 
\cite{Alexandrov2015-clock}, \cite{Nik-Zainal2012-eg}) became a very useful tool of cancer 
investigation in the last years. However, most of the signatures identified so far represent 
complex conglomerates of the action of different mutational processes, deciphering which will 
be essential for understanding the causes of the disease and the most efficient treatment 
options. For some of the signatures, significant associations with various mutational 
processes were identified, although the precise causation is still unclear (\cite{Alexandrov2013-md},
\cite{Alexandrov2015-clock}, \cite{Helleday2014-kw}). For others, no links with the underlying 
mutational processes were found so far. 

The mutational profiles observed in sequencing studies represent the result of interaction 
between damaging and repairing factors, and the ability to disentangle the interactions 
between them which are shaping mutational history of a tumor gives more insight into the 
origins of a particular tumor and may suggest prospective targets for treatment 
(\cite{Alexandrov2013-zu}, \cite{Alexandrov2015-gastric}, \cite{Hollstein2017-ag}, \cite{Poon2014-review}). 
Dissecting the individual contributions of each of DNA repair deficiencies and external 
exposures represents a highly complex task due to  redundancy in DNA repair pathways, 
interaction effects, sequencing artifacts, and high inter- and intra-personal variance 
among patients. Hence the investigation of mutational patterns in a controlled environment 
of a model organism can give a better understanding of underlying biology and shed light 
on the precise contribution of the factors involved (\cite{Meier2014-aa}, \cite{Segovia2015-cr}).

DNA repair mechanisms represent the key component of genome stability maintenance. 
Repair ability deficiencies provide space for major alterations of the genome, both 
by the aggregation of spontaneous mutations and the lack of mutagen resistance. 
There are several major classes of DNA repair pathways: direct reversal, single-strand 
damage repair (such as base excision repair, nucleotide excision repair and mismatch 
repair systems), double-strand break repair (which includes homologous recombination, 
microhomology-mediated end joining and non-homologous end-joining), translesion synthesis, 
and also DNA damage signaling pathways and associated cell cycle control mechanisms 
(\cite{Alberts2007-qn}). Dissecting the individual contribution of each of them represents 
a highly complex task, since many DNA repair components have functions associated with 
different repair pathways, and in some cases these mechanisms may be interchangeable. 
Nevertheless it is possible to investigate the contributions of the most essential 
genetic components and their interplay with each other and with various cytotoxins 
to imitate the processes happening in cancer (\cite{Helleday2014-kw}, \cite{Wu2016-qp}).

The central conceptual parameter of cancer development are the driver genes that 
cause the most important events in individual cancer evolution (\cite{Stratton2009-kh}). 
The set of driver mutations is usually small, but most of them happen in the genes 
essential for cell growth or damage-caused apoptosis (such as tumor suppressor gene 
P53 (\cite{Rivlin2011-cz}) or oncogene KRAS (\cite{Wang2015-ki}) and lead to bursts of mutations directed 
by the effectiveness of particular DNA repair mechanisms. Knowing the individual and 
interaction effects of key elements of genome stability maintenance and environmental 
exposures will provide means to trace back the causes of the disease and predict the 
outcomes of chemo- or radiotherapy in every individual case (\cite{Poon2014-review}).

\section{Aims and concepts of this thesis}

In this thesis, I will describe the experimental mutational signatures of various mutagenic 
agents and DNA repair deficiencies in \textit{C. elegans}, discuss the interplay between 
DNA damage and repair which may result in a dramatic change of mutational patterns in the 
genome, compare experimental results to human cancers and propose strategies for application 
of model organism-derived signatures to cancer signature investigation. The aim of 
this first chapter is to present an overview of processes involved in DNA damage acquisition 
and processing, give a summary of the methods previously developed for analysis of mutational 
signatures in cancer genomes, and describe the current state of DNA repair biology and cancer 
genomics fields and their understanding of mutational signatures.

%%This work was carried on in collaboration with Anton Gartner group at the University of Dundee and WTSI Cancer Genome Project group, and supported by the Consortium for Mutational Signatures (COMSIG).
