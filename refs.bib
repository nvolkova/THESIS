  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Aristolochic acid (AA) is a natural compound found in
              many plants of the Aristolochia genus, and these plants are
              widely used in traditional medicines for numerous conditions and
              for weight loss. Previous work has connected AA-mutagenesis to
              upper-tract urothelial cell carcinomas and hepatocellular
              carcinomas. We hypothesize that AA may also contribute to bladder
              cancer. METHODS: Here, we investigated the involvement of
              AA-mutagenesis in bladder cancer by sequencing bladder tumor
              genomes from two patients with known exposure to AA. After
              detecting strong mutational signatures of AA exposure in these
              tumors, we exome-sequenced and analyzed an additional 11 bladder
              tumors and analyzed publicly available somatic mutation data from
              a further 336 bladder tumors. RESULTS: The somatic mutations in
              the bladder tumors from the two patients with known AA exposure
              showed overwhelming AA signatures. We also detected evidence of
              AA exposure in 1 out of 11 bladder tumors from Singapore and in 3
              out of 99 bladder tumors from China. In addition, 1 out of 194
              bladder tumors from North America showed a pattern of mutations
              that might have resulted from exposure to an unknown mutagen with
              a heretofore undescribed pattern of A > T mutations. Besides the
              signature of AA exposure, the bladder tumors also showed the CpG
              > TpG and activated-APOBEC signatures, which have been previously
              reported in bladder cancer. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates
              the utility of inferring mutagenic exposures from somatic
              mutation spectra. Moreover, AA exposure in bladder cancer appears
              to be more pervasive in the East, where traditional herbal
              medicine is more widely used. More broadly, our results suggest
              that AA exposure is more extensive than previously thought both
              in terms of populations at risk and in terms of types of cancers
              involved. This appears to be an important public health issue
              that should be addressed by further investigation and by primary
              prevention through regulation and education. In addition to
              opportunities for primary prevention, knowledge of AA exposure
              would provide opportunities for secondary prevention in the form
              of intensified screening of patients with known or suspected AA
              exposure.",

              exposure (n=65) were less likely to develop skin cancer than
              those who did not. This may be related to the extreme sun
              protection they receive from an earlier age, decreasing their
              total ultraviolet exposure. Progressive neurologic degeneration
              was present in 24\% (n=25) with 16/25 in complementation group
              XP-D. The most common causes of death were skin cancer (34\%,
              n=10), neurologic degeneration (31\%, n=9), and internal cancer
              (17\%, n=5). The median age at death (29 years) in XP patients
              with neurodegeneration was significantly younger than those XP
              patients without neurodegeneration (37 years) (p=0.02).
              CONCLUSION: This 39 year follow-up study of XP patients indicates
              a major role of DNA repair genes in the aetiology of skin cancer
              and neurologic degeneration.",

              mismatch repair system (microsatellite instability [MSI] tumors)
              have distinct molecular and clinicopathologic profiles, and are
              associated with favorable prognosis. There is evidence suggesting
              that colorectal cancer patients with MSI tumors respond
              differently to adjuvant chemotherapy as compared with patients
              with non-MSI tumors. Finally, determination of the MSI status has
              clinical application for assisting in the diagnosis of suspected
              hereditary cases. It is thus becoming increasingly recognized
              that testing for MSI should be conducted systematically in all
              human cancers potentially of this type. We recently described a
              pentaplex polymerase chain reaction of five mononucleotide
              repeats to establish the MSI status of human tumors, and showed
              that this assay was 100\% sensitive and specific. Moreover, these
              markers are quasimonomorphic in germline DNA of the white
              population (ie, individuals of Eurasian origin), and could be
              used for tumor MSI determination without the requirement for
              matching normal DNA in this group. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this
              study, we analyzed a comparable panel of five mononucleotide
              markers in germline DNA from 1,206 individuals encompassing 55
              different populations worldwide. Results With the exception of
              two Biaka Pygmies and one San individual for whom three markers
              showed variant alleles (three cases [0.2\%]), the remaining 1,203
              individuals showed no alleles of variant size (1,055 cases
              [87.5\%]), or only one (122 cases [10.1\%]) or two (26 cases
              [2.2\%]) markers with variant alleles. All 60 MSI tumors
              investigated display instability in at least four of the five
              markers. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that tumor MSI status can be
              determined using the pentaplex reaction for all human populations

              long-range mate-pairs and split-read alignments to accurately
              delineate genomic rearrangements at single-nucleotide resolution.
              DELLY is suitable for detecting copy-number variable deletion and
              tandem duplication events as well as balanced rearrangements such
              as inversions or reciprocal translocations. DELLY, thus, enables
              to ascertain the full spectrum of genomic rearrangements,

              favorably to other SV prediction methods across a wide range of

              hydroxylation of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) by TET and/or deamination
              by AID/APOBEC family enzymes. The resulting 5mC derivatives are
              removed through the base excision repair (BER) pathway. At
              present, it is unclear how the cell manages to eliminate closely
              spaced 5mC residues whilst avoiding generation of toxic BER
              intermediates and whether alternative DNA repair pathways

              mismatch repair (ncMMR) can remove both alkylated and oxidized
              nucleotides from DNA. Here, a phagemid DNA containing oxidative
              base lesions and methylated sites are used to examine the

              $\epsilon$ (Pol $\epsilon$) is the primary leading strand
              replicase, whereas Pols $\alpha$ and $\delta$ primarily perform
              lagging strand replication. The fact that these polymerases
              differ in fidelity and error specificity is interesting in light
              of the fact that the stability of the nuclear genome depends in
              part on the ability of mismatch repair (MMR) to correct different
              mismatches generated in different contexts during replication.
              Here we provide the first comparison, to our knowledge, of the
              efficiency of MMR of leading and lagging strand replication
              errors. We first use the strand-biased ribonucleotide
              incorporation propensity of a Pol $\epsilon$ mutator variant to
              confirm that Pol $\epsilon$ is the primary leading strand
              replicase in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We then use
              polymerase-specific error signatures to show that MMR efficiency
              in vivo strongly depends on the polymerase, the mismatch
              composition, and the location of the mismatch. An extreme case of
              variation by location is a T-T mismatch that is refractory to
              MMR. This mismatch is flanked by an AT-rich triplet repeat
              sequence that, when interrupted, restores MMR to > 95\%
              efficiency. Thus this natural DNA sequence suppresses MMR,
              placing a nearby base pair at high risk of mutation due to
              leading strand replication infidelity. We find that, overall, MMR
              most efficiently corrects the most potentially deleterious errors
              (indels) and then the most common substitution mismatches. In
              combination with earlier studies, the results suggest that
              significant differences exist in the generation and repair of Pol
              $\alpha$, $\delta$, and $\epsilon$ replication errors, but in a
              generally complementary manner that results in high-fidelity

              hypermutation that occurs at genomic microsatellites and is
              caused by defects in the mismatch repair system. Mismatch repair
              deficiency that leads to MSI has been well described in several
              types of human cancer, most frequently in colorectal,
              endometrial, and gastric adenocarcinomas. MSI is known to be both
              predictive and prognostic, especially in colorectal cancer;
              however, current clinical guidelines only recommend MSI testing
              for colorectal and endometrial cancers. Therefore, less is known
              about the prevalence and extent of MSI among other types of
              cancer. Methods: Using our recently published MSI-calling
              software, MANTIS, we analyzed whole-exome data from 11,139
              tumor-normal pairs from The Cancer Genome Atlas and
              Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate Effective
              Treatments projects and external data sources across 39 cancer
              types. Within a subset of these cancer types, we assessed
              mutation burden, mutational signatures, and somatic variants
              associated with MSI. Results: We identified MSI in 3.8\% of all
              cancers assessed-present in 27 of tumor types-most notably
              adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC), cervical cancer (CESC), and
              mesothelioma, in which MSI has not yet been well described. In
              addition, MSI-high ACC and CESC tumors were observed to have a
              higher average mutational burden than microsatellite-stable ACC
              and CESC tumors. Conclusion: We provide evidence of
              as-yet-unappreciated MSI in several types of cancer. These
              findings support an expanded role for clinical MSI testing across
              multiple cancer types as patients with MSI-positive tumors are

              accurate and processive enzyme that participates in nuclear DNA
              replication of the leading strand template. In addition to a
              large subunit (Pol2) harboring the polymerase and proofreading
              exonuclease active sites, Pol $\epsilon$ also has one essential
              subunit (Dpb2) and two smaller, non-essential subunits (Dpb3 and
              Dpb4) whose functions are not fully understood. To probe the
              functions of Dpb3 and Dpb4, here we investigate the consequences
              of their absence on the biochemical properties of Pol $\epsilon$
              in vitro and on genome stability in vivo. The fidelity of DNA
              synthesis in vitro by purified Pol2/Dpb2, i.e. lacking Dpb3 and
              Dpb4, is comparable to the four-subunit Pol $\epsilon$
              holoenzyme. Nonetheless, deletion of DPB3 and DPB4 elevates
              spontaneous frameshift and base substitution rates in vivo, to
              the same extent as the loss of Pol $\epsilon$ proofreading
              activity in a pol2-4 strain. In contrast to pol2-4, however, the
              dpb3$\Delta$dpb4$\Delta$ does not lead to a synergistic increase
              of mutation rates with defects in DNA mismatch repair. The
              increased mutation rate in dpb3$\Delta$dpb4$\Delta$ strains is
              partly dependent on REV3, as well as the proofreading capacity of
              Pol $\delta$. Finally, biochemical studies demonstrate that the
              absence of Dpb3 and Dpb4 destabilizes the interaction between Pol
              $\epsilon$ and the template DNA during processive DNA synthesis
              and during processive 3' to 5'exonucleolytic degradation of DNA.
              Collectively, these data suggest a model wherein Dpb3 and Dpb4 do
              not directly influence replication fidelity per se, but rather
              contribute to normal replication fork progression. In their
              absence, a defective replisome may more frequently leave gaps on
              the leading strand that are eventually filled by Pol $\zeta$ or
              Pol $\delta$, in a post-replication process that generates errors

              to 3-fold higher than in Pms2(-/-) animals. The higher mutation
              frequency in Mlh1(-/-) mice may be a consequence of some residual

              dinucleotide markers for MSI identification. In any event, no

              awareness of their pros and cons is required for proper

              also an independent prognostic factor for favorable survival in
              multiple cancer types, such as colorectal and endometrial. It
              also informs the choice of chemotherapeutic agents. However, the

              laborious and time-consuming, often requiring visual inspection

              genetic variants with human disease. However, mutation rates are
              not uniform across each eukaryotic genome. Rates for
              insertion/deletion (indel) mutations have been found to vary
              widely when examined in vitro and at specific loci in vivo. Here,
              we report the genome-wide rates of formation and repair of indels
              made during replication of yeast nuclear DNA. Using over 6000
              indels accumulated in four mismatch repair (MMR) defective
              strains, and statistical corrections for false negatives, we find
              that indel rates increase by 100 000-fold with increasing
              homonucleotide run length, representing the greatest effect on
              replication fidelity of any known genomic parameter. Nonetheless,
              long genomic homopolymer runs are overrepresented relative to
              random chance, implying positive selection. Proofreading defects
              in the replicative polymerases selectively increase indel rates
              in short repetitive tracts, likely reflecting the distance over
              which Pols $\delta$ and ϵ interact with duplex DNA upstream of
              the polymerase active site. In contrast, MMR defects hugely
              increase indel mutagenesis in long repetitive sequences. Because
              repetitive sequences are not uniformly distributed among genomic
              functional elements, the quantitatively different consequences on

              This function is critically dependent on the assembling of
              multimeric complexes involved in mismatch recognition and signal
              transduction to downstream repair events. In addition, MMR
              proteins coordinate a complex network of physical and functional
              interactions that mediate other DNA transactions, such as
              transcription-coupled repair, base excision repair and

  abstract = "Microsatellite instability (MSI) is a form of hypermutation that
              occurs in some tumors due to defects in cellular DNA mismatch
              repair. MSI is characterized by frequent somatic mutations (i.e.,
              cancer-specific mutations) that change the length of simple
              repeats (e.g., AAAAA…., GATAGATAGATA...). Clinical MSI tests
              evaluate the lengths of a handful of simple repeat sites, while
              next-generation sequencing can assay many more sites and offers a
              much more complete view of their somatic mutation frequencies.
              Using somatic mutation data from the exomes of a 361-tumor
              training set, we developed classifiers to determine MSI status
              based on four machine-learning frameworks. All frameworks had
              high accuracy, and after choosing one we determined that it had
              >98\% concordance with clinical tests in a separate 163-tumor
              test set. Furthermore, this classifier retained high concordance
              even when classifying tumors based on subsets of whole-exome
              data. We have released a CRAN R package, MSIseq, based on this
              classifier. MSIseq is faster and simpler to use than software
              that requires large files of aligned sequenced reads. MSIseq will
              be useful for genomic studies in which clinical MSI test results
              are unavailable and for detecting possible misclassifications by
              clinical tests.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project has generated
              genomic data sets covering over 20 malignancies. These data
              provide valuable insights into the underlying genetic and genomic
              basis of cancer. However, exploring the relationship among TCGA
              genomic results and clinical phenotype remains a challenge,
              particularly for individuals lacking formal bioinformatics
              training. Overcoming this hurdle is an important step toward the
              wider clinical translation of cancer genomic/proteomic data and
              implementation of precision cancer medicine. Several websites
              such as the cBio portal or University of California Santa Cruz
              genome browser make TCGA data accessible but lack interactive
              features for querying clinically relevant phenotypic associations
              with cancer drivers. To enable exploration of the
              clinical-genomic driver associations from TCGA data, we developed
              the Cancer Genome Atlas Clinical Explorer. DESCRIPTION: The
              Cancer Genome Atlas Clinical Explorer interface provides a
              straightforward platform to query TCGA data using one of the
              following methods: (1) searching for clinically relevant genes,
              micro RNAs, and proteins by name, cancer types, or clinical
              parameters; (2) searching for genomic/proteomic profile changes
              by clinical parameters in a cancer type; or (3) testing two-hit
              hypotheses. SQL queries run in the background and results are
              displayed on our portal in an easy-to-navigate interface
              according to user's input. To derive these associations, we
              relied on elastic-net estimates of optimal multiple linear
              regularized regression and clinical parameters in the space of
              multiple genomic/proteomic features provided by TCGA data.
              Moreover, we identified and ranked gene/micro RNA/protein
              predictors of each clinical parameter for each cancer. The
              robustness of the results was estimated by bootstrapping.
              Overall, we identify associations of potential clinical relevance
              among genes/micro RNAs/proteins using our statistical analysis
              from 25 cancer types and 18 clinical parameters that include
              clinical stage or smoking history. CONCLUSION: The Cancer Genome
              Atlas Clinical Explorer enables the cancer research community and
              others to explore clinically relevant associations inferred from
              TCGA data. With its accessible web and mobile interface, users
              can examine queries and test hypothesis regarding
              genomic/proteomic alterations across a broad spectrum of
              malignancies.",

              also recognizes mispaired bases in recombination (HR)
              intermediates. Exonuclease 1 (Exo1) is a 5' $\rightarrow$ 3'
              exonuclease that participates in a number of DNA repair pathways.
              Exo1 was identified as an exonuclease that participates in
              Saccharomyces cerevisiae and human MMR where it functions to
              excise the daughter strand after mispair recognition, and
              additionally Exo1 functions in end resection during HR. However,
              Exo1 is not absolutely required for end resection during HR in
              vivo. Similarly, while Exo1 is required in MMR reactions that
              have been reconstituted in vitro, genetics studies have shown
              that it is not absolutely required for MMR in vivo suggesting the
              existence of Exo1-independent and Exo1-dependent MMR subpathways.
              Here, we review what is known about the Exo1-independent and

  abstract = "AIMS: The genetic abnormality known as microsatellite instability
              (MSI), first identified in colorectal cancer in 1993, has
              subsequently been recognised in other malignancies. These cancers
              are caused by a defect in the nuclear mismatch repair system,
              allowing mutations to accumulate with every cellular division.
              Hereditary Non Polyposis Colon Cancers (HNPCC) and associated
              malignancies demonstrating MSI have a unique histological
              appearance, improved prognosis and altered response to
              chemotherapy and radiotherapy. This review examines the incidence
              of MSI and its clinical significance in commonly occurring solid
              malignancies. METHOD: A medline based literature search was
              performed using the key words 'Microsatellite Instability' and
              the name of the specific malignancy being investigated.
              Additional original papers were obtained from citations in those
              articles identified in the original medline search. RESULTS: MSI
              has been detected in many solid malignancies although the
              definition of instability applied has been variable. It is most
              commonly found in sporadic malignancies that also occur in the
              HNPCC syndrome such as colorectal, stomach, endometrial and
              ovarian cancer. MSI may impart a favorable prognosis in
              colorectal, gastric, pancreatic and probably oesophageal cancers
              but a poor prognosis in non small cell lung cancer. In clinical
              studies colorectal cancers demonstrating MSI respond better to
              chemotherapy while in vitro studies using MSI positive cell lines
              show resistance to radiotherapy and chemotherapy. CONCLUSION: MSI
              may be a useful genetic marker in prognosis and could be an
              influential factor in deciding treatment options. However, in
              many cancers its significance remains unclear and more evaluation

              This molecular subset of CRC characterizes patients with better
              stage-specific prognoses who experience no benefit from
              5-fluorouracil chemotherapy. Most MMR-deficient (dMMR) CRCs are
              sporadic, but 15\% to 20\% are due to inherited predisposition
              (Lynch syndrome). High penetrance of CRCs in germline MMR gene
              mutation carriers emphasizes the importance of accurate diagnosis
              of Lynch syndrome carriers. Family-based (Amsterdam),
              patient/family-based (Bethesda), morphology-based,
              microsatellite-based, and IHC-based screening criteria do not
              individually detect all germline mutation carriers. These
              limitations support the use of multiple concurrent tests and the
              screening of all patients with newly diagnosed CRC. This approach
              is resource intensive but would increase detection of inherited
              and de novo germline mutations to guide family screening.
              Although CRC prognosis and prediction of 5-fluorouracil response
              are similar in both the Lynch and sporadic dMMR subgroups, these
              subgroups differ significantly with regard to the implications

              classified into sporadic MMR-proficient, sporadic dMMR, or Lynch
              dMMR subgroups. The concurrent use of MSI testing, MMR protein
              IHC, and BRAF c.1799T>A mutation analysis would detect almost all
              dMMR CRCs, would classify 94\% of all new CRCs into these MMR

              DNA repair-deficient backgrounds propagated for 20 generations or

              altered across several DNA repair deficiencies over 20
              generations. Telomere erosion led to complex chromosomal

              breakpoints. Aflatoxin B1 induced substitutions of guanines in a

              Similarly, in the mouse model, Mlh1-/- animals are highly cancer

              mutator phenotype, with markedly elevated TCT$\rightarrow$TAT and
              TCG$\rightarrow$TTG mutations and overall mutation frequencies
              often exceeding 100 mutations/Mb. Here, we identify POLE-exo*
              tumors in numerous cancers and classify them into two groups, A
              and B, according to their mutational properties. Group A mutants
              are found only in POLE, whereas Group B mutants are found in POLE
              and POLD1 and appear to be nonfunctional. In Group A, cell-free
              polymerase assays confirm that mutations in the exonuclease
              domain result in high mutation frequencies with a preference for
              C$\rightarrow$A mutation. We describe the patterns of amino acid
              substitutions caused by POLE-exo* and compare them to other tumor
              types. The nucleotide preference of POLE-exo* leads to increased
              frequencies of recurrent nonsense mutations in key tumor
              suppressors such as TP53, ATM, and PIK3R1. We further demonstrate
              that strand-specific mutation patterns arise from some of these
              POLE-exo* mutants during genome duplication. This is the first
              direct proof of leading strand-specific replication by human
              POLE, which has only been demonstrated in yeast so far. Taken
              together, the extremely high mutation frequency and strand

  abstract = "DNA mismatch repair is a highly conserved DNA repair pathway. In
              humans, germline mutations in hMSH2 or hMLH1, key components of
              mismatch repair, have been associated with Lynch syndrome, a
              leading cause of inherited cancer mortality. Current estimates of
              the mutation rate and the mutational spectra in mismatch repair
              defective cells are primarily limited to a small number of
              individual reporter loci. Here we use the yeast Saccharomyces
              cerevisiae to generate a genome-wide view of the rates, spectra,
              and distribution of mutation in the absence of mismatch repair.
              We performed mutation accumulation assays and next generation
              sequencing on 19 strains, including 16 msh2 missense variants
              implicated in Lynch cancer syndrome. The mutation rate for DNA
              mismatch repair null strains was approximately 1 mutation per
              genome per generation, 225-fold greater than the wild-type rate.
              The mutations were distributed randomly throughout the genome,
              independent of replication timing. The mutation spectra included
              insertions/deletions at homopolymeric runs (87.7\%) and at larger
              microsatellites (5.9\%), as well as transitions (4.5\%) and
              transversions (1.9\%). Additionally, repeat regions with proximal
              repeats are more likely to be mutated. A bias toward deletions at
              homopolymers and insertions at (AT)n microsatellites suggests a
              different mechanism for mismatch generation at these sites.
              Interestingly, 5\% of the single base pair substitutions might
              represent double-slippage events that occurred at the junction of
              immediately adjacent repeats, resulting in a shift in the repeat
              boundary. These data suggest a closer scrutiny of tumor
              suppressors with homopolymeric runs with proximal repeats as the
              potential drivers of oncogenesis in mismatch repair defective

              human cancer. Very recently, a novel approach for data mining of
              the vast compilations of tumour NGS data succeeded in separating
              and precisely defining at least 30 distinct patterns of sequence
              change hidden in mutation databases. At least half of these

              sequence of tumours, and culminating in empirical evidence from
              NGS data that well-defined carcinogen mutational signatures are
              indeed present in tumour genomic DNA from a variety of cancer
              types. The notion that tumour DNAs can divulge environmental
              sources of mutation is now a well-accepted fact. This approach to

              orphan and newly discovered tumour mutation patterns, and to
              determine whether avoidable cancer risk factors influence
              signatures produced by endogenous enzymatic mechanisms.

              sequencing of 10 independent clones of cisplatin-exposed MCF-10A
              and HepG2 cells and delineated the patterns of single and
              dinucleotide mutations in terms of flanking sequence,

              hepatocellular carcinomas and esophageal adenocarcinomas. All

              substitutions was high: 8.1\% of single nucleotide substitutions

              cisplatin's propensity to form intra- and interstrand crosslinks

              the single and dinucleotide mutational signature of cisplatin.
              This signature enabled us to detect previous cisplatin exposure

              this heterodimer, hMutSalpha, has high affinity for a G/T
              mismatch [9,10]. Cell lines in which the 160 kDa subunit of
              hMutSalpha is mutated are specifically defective in the repair of
              base-base and single-nucleotide insertion/deletion mismatches
              [9,11]. Genetic studies in S. cerevisiae have suggested that MSH2
              functions with either MSH3 or MSH6 in mismatch repair, and, in
              the absence of the latter two genes, MSH2 is inactive [12,13].
              MSH6 encodes the yeast counterpart of the 160 kDa subunit of
              hMutSalpha [12,13]. As in humans, yeast MSH6 forms a complex with
              MSH2, and the MSH2-MSH6 heterodimer binds a G/T mismatch [14].
              Here, we find that MSH2 and MSH3 form another stable heterodimer,
              and we purify this heterodimer to near homogeneity. We show that
              MSH2-MSH3 has low affinity for a G/T mismatch but binds to
              insertion/deletion mismatches with high specificity, unlike
              MSH2-MSH6.",

              Until recently, it has been possible to connect the chemical
              characteristics of mutagens to actual mutations observed in human
              tumors only indirectly. Now, next-generation sequencing
              technology enables us to observe in detail the DNA-sequence-level
              effects of well-known mutagens, such as ultraviolet radiation and
              tobacco smoke, as well as endogenous mutagenic processes, such as
              those involving activated DNA cytidine deaminases (APOBECs). We
              can also observe the effects of less well-known but potent
              mutagens, including those recently found to be present in some
              herbal remedies. Crucially, we can now tease apart the

              review and unify the field. The following recommendations were
              endorsed at the workshop. (a) The form of genomic instability
              associated with defective DNA mismatch repair in tumors is to be
              called microsatellite instability (MSI). (b) A panel of five
              microsatellites has been validated and is recommended as a
              reference panel for future research in the field. Tumors may be
              characterized on the basis of: high-frequency MSI (MSI-H), if two
              or more of the five markers show instability (i.e., have
              insertion/deletion mutations), and low-frequency MSI (MSI-L), if
              only one of the five markers shows instability. The distinction
              between microsatellite stable (MSS) and low frequency MSI (MSI-L)
              can only be accomplished if a greater number of markers is
              utilized. (c) A unique clinical and pathological phenotype is
              identified for the MSI-H tumors, which comprise approximately
              15\% of colorectal cancers, whereas MSI-L and MSS tumors appear
              to be phenotypically similar. MSI-H colorectal tumors are found
              predominantly in the proximal colon, have unique
              histopathological features, and are associated with a less
              aggressive clinical course than are stage-matched MSI-L or MSS
              tumors. Preclinical models suggest the possibility that these
              tumors may be resistant to the cytotoxicity induced by certain
              chemotherapeutic agents. The implications for MSI-L are not yet
              clear. (d) MSI can be measured in fresh or fixed tumor specimens
              equally well; microdissection of pathological specimens is
              recommended to enrich for neoplastic tissue; and normal tissue is
              required to document the presence of MSI. (e) The ``Bethesda
              guidelines,'' which were developed in 1996 to assist in the
              selection of tumors for microsatellite analysis, are endorsed.
              (f) The spectrum of microsatellite alterations in noncolonic
              tumors was reviewed, and it was concluded that the above
              recommendations apply only to colorectal neoplasms. (g) A

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Somatic mutations have the potential to encode
              ``non-self'' immunogenic antigens. We hypothesized that tumors
              with a large number of somatic mutations due to mismatch-repair
              defects may be susceptible to immune checkpoint blockade.
              METHODS: We conducted a phase 2 study to evaluate the clinical
              activity of pembrolizumab, an anti-programmed death 1 immune
              checkpoint inhibitor, in 41 patients with progressive metastatic
              carcinoma with or without mismatch-repair deficiency.
              Pembrolizumab was administered intravenously at a dose of 10 mg
              per kilogram of body weight every 14 days in patients with
              mismatch repair-deficient colorectal cancers, patients with
              mismatch repair-proficient colorectal cancers, and patients with
              mismatch repair-deficient cancers that were not colorectal. The
              coprimary end points were the immune-related objective response
              rate and the 20-week immune-related progression-free survival
              rate. RESULTS: The immune-related objective response rate and
              immune-related progression-free survival rate were 40\% (4 of 10
              patients) and 78\% (7 of 9 patients), respectively, for mismatch
              repair-deficient colorectal cancers and 0\% (0 of 18 patients)
              and 11\% (2 of 18 patients) for mismatch repair-proficient
              colorectal cancers. The median progression-free survival and
              overall survival were not reached in the cohort with mismatch
              repair-deficient colorectal cancer but were 2.2 and 5.0 months,
              respectively, in the cohort with mismatch repair-proficient
              colorectal cancer (hazard ratio for disease progression or death,
              0.10 [P<0.001], and hazard ratio for death, 0.22 [P=0.05]).
              Patients with mismatch repair-deficient noncolorectal cancer had
              responses similar to those of patients with mismatch
              repair-deficient colorectal cancer (immune-related objective
              response rate, 71\% [5 of 7 patients]; immune-related
              progression-free survival rate, 67\% [4 of 6 patients]).
              Whole-exome sequencing revealed a mean of 1782 somatic mutations
              per tumor in mismatch repair-deficient tumors, as compared with
              73 in mismatch repair-proficient tumors (P=0.007), and high
              somatic mutation loads were associated with prolonged
              progression-free survival (P=0.02). CONCLUSIONS: This study
              showed that mismatch-repair status predicted clinical benefit of
              immune checkpoint blockade with pembrolizumab. (Funded by Johns

  title    = "Nucleotide excision repair deficiency in melanoma in response to
              {UVA}",
  author   = "Murray, Heather C and Maltby, Vicki E and Smith, Doug W and

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: The causative link between UV exposure and melanoma
              development is well known, however the mechanistic relationship
              remains incompletely characterised. UVA and UVB components of
              sunlight are implicated in melanomagenesis; however the majority
              of studies have focused on the effects of UVB and UVC light.
              Interestingly, melanoma tumour sequencing has revealed an
              overrepresentation of mutations signature of unrepaired
              UV-induced DNA damage. Repair of UVA-induced DNA damage is
              thought to occur primarily through the Nucleotide Excision Repair
              (NER) pathway, which recognises and repairs damage either coupled
              to transcription (Transcription Coupled Repair; TCR), or through
              global genome scanning (Global Genome Repair; GGR). Current
              literature suggests NER is deficient in melanoma, however the
              cause of this remains unknown; and whether reduced NER activity
              in response to UVA may be involved in melanoma development
              remains uncharacterised. In this study we aimed to determine if
              melanoma cells exhibit reduced levels of NER activity in response
              to UVA. METHODS: Melanocyte and melanoma cell lines were
              UVA-irradiated, and DNA damage levels assessed by immunodetection
              of Cyclobutane Pyrimidine Dimer (CPD) and (6-4) Photoproduct
              [(6-4)PP] lesions. Expression of NER pathway components and p53
              following UVA treatment was quantified by qPCR and western blot.
              RESULTS: UVA did not induce detectable induction of (6-4)PP
              lesions, consistent with previous studies. Repair of CPDs induced
              by UVA was initiated at 4 h and complete within 48 h in normal
              melanocytes, whereas repair initiation was delayed to 24 h and
              >40 \% of lesions remained in melanoma cell lines at 48 h. This
              was coupled with a delayed and reduced induction of GGR component
              XPC in melanoma cells, independent of p53. CONCLUSION: These
              findings support that NER activity is reduced in melanoma cells
              due to deficient GGR. Further investigation into the role of NER
              in UVA-induced melanomagenesis is warranted and may have
              implications for melanoma treatment.",

              is implicated in multiple cancer types, sometimes with very high
              mutational burdens, especially in upper tract urothelial cancers
              (UTUCs). AA-associated kidney failure and UTUCs are prevalent in
              Taiwan, but AA's role in hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) there
              remains unexplored. Therefore, we sequenced the whole exomes of
              98 HCCs from two hospitals in Taiwan and found that 78\% showed
              the distinctive mutational signature of AA exposure, accounting
              for most of the nonsilent mutations in known cancer driver genes.
              We then searched for the AA signature in 1400 HCCs from diverse
              geographic regions. Consistent with exposure through known herbal
              medicines, 47\% of Chinese HCCs showed the signature, albeit with
              lower mutation loads than in Taiwan. In addition, 29\% of HCCs
              from Southeast Asia showed the signature. The AA signature was
              also detected in 13 and 2.7\% of HCCs from Korea and Japan as
              well as in 4.8 and 1.7\% of HCCs from North America and Europe,
              respectively, excluding one U.S. hospital where 22\% of 87
              ``Asian'' HCCs had the signature. Thus, AA exposure is
              geographically widespread. Asia, especially Taiwan, appears to be
              much more extensively affected, which is consistent with other
              evidence of patterns of AA exposure. We propose that additional
              measures aimed at primary prevention through avoidance of AA
              exposure and investigation of possible approaches to secondary

              the level of AL-dA adducts in human fibroblasts treated with AA
              to determine if this marked strand bias could be accounted for by
              selective resistance to global-genome nucleotide excision repair
              (GG-NER). AL-dA adduct levels were elevated in cells deficient in
              GG-NER and transcription-coupled NER, but not in XPC cell lines
              lacking GG-NER only. In vitro, plasmids containing a single AL-dA
              adduct were resistant to the early recognition and incision steps
              of NER. Additionally, the NER damage sensor, XPC-RAD23B, failed
              to specifically bind to AL-DNA adducts. However, placing AL-dA in
              mismatched sequences promotes XPC-RAD23B binding and renders this
              adduct susceptible to NER, suggesting that specific structural
              features of this adduct prevent processing by NER. We conclude
              that AL-dA adducts are not recognized by GG-NER, explaining their
              high mutagenicity and persistence in target tissues.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) is
              highly expressed in over 80\% of tumors, including human
              epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). However, the mechanisms through
              which hTERT is up-regulated in EOC and promotes tumor progression
              remain unclear. The aim of this study is to identify RIF1 as a
              novel molecular target that modulate hTERT signaling and EOC
              growth. METHODS: RIF1 expression in ovarian cancer, benign and
              normal ovarian tissues was examined by immunohistochemistry. The
              biological role of RIF1 was revealed by MTS, colony formation and
              sphere formation assays. Luciferase reporter assay and chromatin
              immunoprecipitation (CHIP) assay were used to verify RIF1 as a
              novel hTERT promoter-binding protein in EOC cells. The role of
              RIF1 on tumorigenesis in vivo was detected by the xenograft
              model. RESULTS: RIF1 expression is upregulated in EOC tissues and
              is closely correlated with FIGO stage and prognosis of EOC
              patients. Functionally, RIF1 knockdown suppressed the expression
              and promoter activity of hTERT and consequently inhibited the
              growth and CSC-like traits of EOC cells. RIF1 knockdown also
              inhibited tumorigenesis in xenograft model. RIF1 overexpression
              had the opposite effect. Luciferase reporter assay and ChIP assay
              verified RIF1 directly bound to hTERT promoter to upregulate its
              expression. The rescue experiments suggested hTERT overexpression
              rescued the inhibition of EOC cell growth and CSC-like traits
              mediated by RIF1 knockdown. Consistently, hTERT knockdown
              abrogated the RIF1-induced promotion of EOC cell growth and
              CSC-like traits. CONCLUSIONS: RIF1 promotes EOC progression by
              activating hTERT and the RIF1/hTERT pathway may be a potential
              therapeutic target for EOC patients.",

              From a microevolution standpoint, these are subject to positive

              wild-type coding sequences are needed for tumor growth are also

              completely confounded by the genomic heterogeneity of cancer
              mutation. Here we present a hierarchical framework that allows
              modeling of coding point mutations. Application of the model to

              power to detect known cancer driver genes and identifies new

               with defects in the MutS, MutL or MutH components of MMR. All
               strains used contained the F'prolac from strain CC102 (F'CC102)
               episome capable of detecting specifically lac GC to AT reverse
               mutations resulting from O(6)-alkylguanine. The results showed
               the repair of O(6)-methylguanine to be performed by AGT ≫ MMR >
               NER in order of importance, whereas the repair of
               O(6)-ethylguanine followed the order NER > AGT > MMR. Studies
               with double mutants showed that in the absence of AGT or NER
               repair pathways, the lack of MutS protein generally increased
               mutant frequencies for both methylating and ethylating agents,
               suggesting a repair or mutation avoidance role for this protein.
               However, lack of MutL or MutH protein did not increase
               alkylation-induced mutagenesis under these conditions and, in
               fact, reduced mutagenesis by the N-alkyl-N-nitrosoureas MNU and

               DNA may promote the involvement of a repair system other than
               MMR to avoid a mutagenic outcome. Furthermore, both mutagenic
               and antimutagenic effects of MMR were detected, revealing a dual

              from chemotherapy but are still exposed to its toxic effects.
              Therefore, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the genes
              involved in nucleotide excision repair (NER) mechanism may be a
              potential predictive factor of efficiency of cytostatic based
              chemotherapy. The aim of the study was to evaluate the
              correlation between SNPs of the genes involved in NER mechanism
              and the effectiveness of chemotherapy based on cisplatin and
              gemcitabine in patients with advanced NSCLC. The study group
              included 91 NSCLC patients treated with first-line chemotherapy
              using cisplatin and gemcitabine. Genotyping was carried out using
              a mini-sequencing technique (SNaPshot™ PCR). The median
              progression-free survival (PFS) was significantly shorter in
              carriers of CC genotype of the XPD/ERCC2 (2251A > C) gene

              MMR deficiency is the lack of elevated levels of NCG > NTG
              mutations in C. elegans, likely caused by the absence of cytosine
              (CpG) methylation in worms. The other two human MMR signatures

              mutagenic processes, but their exact cause remains unknown. In

              whole-genome and exome data sets conformed to the stringent
              criteria indicative of an APOBEC mutation pattern. Applying these
              criteria to 954,247 mutations in 2,680 exomes from 14 cancer
              types, mostly from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), showed a
              significant presence of the APOBEC mutation pattern in bladder,
              cervical, breast, head and neck, and lung cancers, reaching 68\%
              of all mutations in some samples. Within breast cancer, the
              HER2-enriched subtype was clearly enriched for tumors with the
              APOBEC mutation pattern, suggesting that this type of mutagenesis
              is functionally linked with cancer development. The APOBEC
              mutation pattern also extended to cancer-associated genes,
              implying that ubiquitous APOBEC-mediated mutagenesis is

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Cisplatin is one of the major drugs that used in the
              treatment of osteosarcoma. Cisplatin exerts its function by
              making cisplatin-DNA adducts culminating in cellular death. These
              adducts found to be repaired by nucleotide excision repair (NER)
              pathway. This study aimed to evaluate if polymorphisms in two
              main genes in the NER pathway, excision repair
              cross-complementing group 1 and 2 (ERCC1 and ERCC2) could affect
              the histological response to cisplatin based chemotherapy or
              clinical outcomes, particularly, event free survival (EFS) and
              overall survival (OS) rates. METHOD: ERCC1 (C118T (rs11615) and
              C8092A (rs3212986)) and ERCC2 (A751C (rs171140) and G312A
              (rs1799793)) polymorphisms were analysed in 44 patients with
              osteosarcoma, who were treated with cisplatin based neoadjuvant
              chemotherapy. DNA was extracted from patient's formalin-fixed
              paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples, patient's genotypes were
              determined by using polymerase chain reaction-restriction
              fragment length polymorphism PCR-RFLP assay. The distribution of
              the patients' genotype and the allele frequencies were reported.
              The association between each of these genotypes and many clinical
              and patho-histological parameters (e.g. EFS, OS and
              patho-histological response to treatment) was examined. The

              metastasis at diagnosis, histological subtypes, and type of
              neoadjuvant chemotherapy and between the histological response,
              EFS and OS rates were also examined. RESULTS: This study revealed
              that there was a positive and significant association between
              ERCC1 C8092 A genotypes and median EFS rate in years; patients
              who were carriers of C allele (CC \& CA) were found to have
              longer EFS rates than patients with AA genotype (P value = 0.006)
              and the median EFS rates were respectively as following: 2.04,
              0.24 years. As well, both the presence of metastasis and the
              histological subtype at the time of diagnosis, were able to
              affect the EFS rate but not the OS. However, there was a positive

              DNA repair was determined in a four decade natural history study.
              METHODS: All 106 XP patients admitted to the National Institutes
              of Health from 1971 to 2009 were evaluated from clinical records
              and follow-up. RESULTS: In the 65 per cent (n=69) of patients
              with skin cancer, non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) was increased
              10,000-fold and melanoma was increased 2000-fold in patients
              under age 20. The 9 year median age at diagnosis of first
              non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) (n=64) was significantly younger
              than the 22 year median age at diagnosis of first melanoma
              (n=38)-a relative age reversal from the general population
              suggesting different mechanisms of carcinogenesis between NMSC
              and melanoma. XP patients with pronounced burning on minimal sun
              exposure (n=65) were less likely to develop skin cancer than
              those who did not. This may be related to the extreme sun
              protection they receive from an earlier age, decreasing their
              total ultraviolet exposure. Progressive neurologic degeneration
              was present in 24\% (n=25) with 16/25 in complementation group
              XP-D. The most common causes of death were skin cancer (34\%,
              n=10), neurologic degeneration (31\%, n=9), and internal cancer
              (17\%, n=5). The median age at death (29 years) in XP patients
              with neurodegeneration was significantly younger than those XP
              patients without neurodegeneration (37 years) (p=0.02).
              CONCLUSION: This 39 year follow-up study of XP patients indicates

              The model makes the prediction, validated by our empirical

              after cisplatin chemotherapy. We performed whole genome
              sequencing of 10 independent clones of cisplatin-exposed MCF-10A
              and HepG2 cells and delineated the patterns of single and
              dinucleotide mutations in terms of flanking sequence,

              hepatocellular carcinomas and esophageal adenocarcinomas. All
              clones showed highly consistent patterns of single and

              substitutions was high: 8.1\% of single nucleotide substitutions
              were part of dinucleotide substitutions, presumably due to
              cisplatin's propensity to form intra- and interstrand crosslinks

              S-adenosylmethionine, the reactive methyl donor, and by reaction
              with alkylating agents. 3-MeA protrudes into the DNA minor groove
              and strongly blocks synthesis by replicative DNA polymerases
              (Pols). However, the mechanisms for replicating through this

              roles of translesion synthesis (TLS) Pols in the replication of
              3-MeA-damaged DNA in human cells. Because 3-MeA has a short
              half-life in vitro, we used the stable 3-deaza analog,
              3-deaza-3-methyladenine (3-dMeA), which blocks the DNA minor
              groove similarly to 3-MeA. We found that replication through the
              3-dMeA adduct is mediated via three different pathways, dependent
              upon Pol$\iota$/Pol$\kappa$, Pol$\vartheta$, and Pol$\zeta$. As
              inferred from biochemical studies, in the Pol$\iota$/Pol$\kappa$
              pathway, Pol$\iota$ inserts a nucleotide (nt) opposite 3-dMeA and
              Pol$\kappa$ extends synthesis from the inserted nt. In the
              Pol$\vartheta$ pathway, Pol$\vartheta$ carries out both the
              insertion and extension steps of TLS opposite 3-dMeA, and in the
              Pol$\zeta$ pathway, Pol$\zeta$ extends synthesis following nt
              insertion by an as yet unidentified Pol. Steady-state kinetic
              analyses indicated that Pol$\iota$ and Pol$\vartheta$ insert the
              correct nt T opposite 3-dMeA with a much reduced catalytic
              efficiency and that both Pols exhibit a high propensity for
              inserting a wrong nt opposite this adduct. However, despite their
              low fidelity of synthesis opposite 3-dMeA, TLS opposite this
              lesion replicates DNA in a highly error-free manner in human
              cells. We discuss the implications of these observations for TLS

              There were statistically significant recurrent mutations in 32

              metabolites, N-hydroxyaristolactams (AL-NOHs), and their
              N-O-sulfonated and N-O-acetylated derivatives to react with DNA
              to form aristolactam-DNA adducts. AL-NOHs displayed little or no
              activity in this regard while the sulfo- and acetyl compounds
              readily form DNA adducts, as detected by (32)P-post-labeling
              analysis. Mouse hepatic and renal cytosols stimulated binding of
              AL-NOHs to DNA in the presence of adenosine 3'-phosphate
              5'-phosphosulfate (PAPS) but not of acetyl-CoA. Using Time of
              Flight liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry,
              N-hydroxyaristolactam I formed the sulfated compound in the
              presence of PAPS and certain human sulfotransferases, SULT1B1 >
              SULT1A2 > SULT1A1 > SULT1A3. The same pattern of SULT reactivity
              was observed when N-hydroxyaristolactam I was incubated with
              these enzymes and PAPS and the reaction was monitored by
              formation of aristolactam-DNA adducts. In the presence of human

              serve as substrates for SULT1B1, producing N-sulfated esters,

              advanced cancer? The best estimates for this number have been
              provided by mathematical models based on the relation between age
              and incidence. For example, the classic studies of Nordling

              Relative risks of breast cancer declined significantly with age

              frequently inactivated by mutation or deletion in most human
              tumours. A tremendous effort has been made to restore p53
              activity in cancer therapies. However, no effective p53-based
              therapy has been successfully translated into clinical cancer
              treatment owing to the complexity of p53 signalling. Here we
              demonstrate that genomic deletion of TP53 frequently encompasses
              essential neighbouring genes, rendering cancer cells with
              hemizygous TP53 deletion vulnerable to further suppression of
              such genes. POLR2A is identified as such a gene that is almost
              always co-deleted with TP53 in human cancers. It encodes the
              largest and catalytic subunit of the RNA polymerase II complex,
              which is specifically inhibited by $\alpha$-amanitin. Our
              analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Cancer Cell Line
              Encyclopedia (CCLE) databases reveals that POLR2A expression
              levels are tightly correlated with its gene copy numbers in human
              colorectal cancer. Suppression of POLR2A with $\alpha$-amanitin
              or small interfering RNAs selectively inhibits the proliferation,
              survival and tumorigenic potential of colorectal cancer cells
              with hemizygous TP53 loss in a p53-independent manner. Previous
              clinical applications of $\alpha$-amanitin have been limited
              owing to its liver toxicity. However, we found that
              $\alpha$-amanitin-based antibody-drug conjugates are highly
              effective therapeutic agents with reduced toxicity. Here we show
              that low doses of $\alpha$-amanitin-conjugated anti-epithelial
              cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) antibody lead to complete tumour
              regression in mouse models of human colorectal cancer with
              hemizygous deletion of POLR2A. We anticipate that inhibiting
              POLR2A will be a new therapeutic approach for human cancers
              containing such common genomic alterations.",

              replication protein A (RPA), which then serves as a platform for
              recruitment and activation of replication stress response
              factors. Cells deficient in this response are characterized by
              extensive ssDNA formation and excessive RPA recruitment that
              exhausts the available pool of RPA, which (i) inhibits
              RPA-dependent processes such as nucleotide excision repair (NER)
              and (ii) causes catastrophic failure of blocked RF. Here, we
              investigated the influence of RPA availability on
              chemosensitivity using a panel of human HGSOC cell lines. Our
              data revealed a striking correlation among these cell lines
              between cisplatin sensitivity and the inability to efficiently
              repair DNA via NER, specifically during S phase. Such defects in
              NER were attributable to RPA exhaustion arising from aberrant
              activation of DNA replication origins during replication stress.
              Reduced RPA availability promoted Mre11-dependent degradation of
              nascent DNA at stalled RF in cell lines exhibiting elevated
              sensitivity to cisplatin. Strikingly, defective S-phase NER, RF
              instability, and cisplatin sensitivity could all be rescued by
              ectopic overexpression of RPA. Taken together, our findings
              indicate that RPA exhaustion represents a major determinant of
              cisplatin sensitivity in HGSOC cell lines. The influence of
              replication protein A exhaustion on cisplatin sensitivity harbors
              important implications toward improving therapy of various
              cancers that initially respond to platinum-based agents but later
              relapse due to intrinsic or acquired drug resistance. .",

              characterization of more than ten thousand tumors, enabling the
              discovery of novel driver mutations, molecular subtypes, and
              enticing drug targets across many histologies. Here we
              investigated why some mutations are common in particular cancer
              types but absent in others. As an example, we observed that the
              gene CCDC168 has no mutations in the stomach adenocarcinoma
              (STAD) cohort despite its common presence in other tumor types.
              Surprisingly, we found that the lack of called mutations was due
              to a systematic insufficiency in the number of sequencing reads
              in the STAD and other cohorts, as opposed to differential driver
              biology. Using strict filtering criteria, we found similar
              behavior in four other genes across TCGA cohorts, with each gene
              exhibiting systematic sequencing depth issues affecting the
              ability to call mutations. We identified the culprit as the
              choice of exome capture kit, as kit choice was highly associated
              with the set of genes that have insufficient reads to call a
              mutation. Overall, we found that thousands of samples across all
              cohorts are subject to some capture kit problems. For example,
              for the 6353 samples using the Broad Institute's Custom capture
              kit there are undercalling biases for at least 4833 genes. False

              revealed that RIF1 was highly expressed in NCSLC at both mRNA and
              protein levels. RIF1 expression was significantly associated with
              clinical stage (P < 0.05) and prognosis (P < 0.001) of NSCLC
              patients. RIF1 knockdown inhibited NSCLC cell growth in vitro and

              cancer chemotherapy may cause secondary malignancies as well as
              contribute to the evolution of treatment-resistant tumour cells.
              The stable diploid genome of the chicken DT40 lymphoblast cell
              line, an established DNA repair model system, is well suited to
              accurately assay genomic mutations. RESULTS: We use whole genome
              sequencing of multiple DT40 clones to determine the mutagenic
              effect of eight common cytotoxics used for the treatment of
              millions of patients worldwide. We determine the spontaneous
              mutagenesis rate at 2.3 $\times$ 10(-10) per base per cell
              division and find that cisplatin, cyclophosphamide and etoposide
              induce extra base substitutions with distinct spectra. After four
              cycles of exposure, cisplatin induces 0.8 mutations per Mb,
              equivalent to the median mutational burden in common leukaemias.
              Cisplatin-induced mutations, including short insertions and
              deletions, are mainly located at sites of putative intrastrand
              crosslinks. We find two of the newly defined cisplatin-specific
              mutation types as causes of the reversion of BRCA2 mutations in
              emerging cisplatin-resistant tumours or cell clones. Gemcitabine,
              5-fluorouracil, hydroxyurea, doxorubicin and paclitaxel have no
              measurable mutagenic effect. The cisplatin-induced mutation
              spectrum shows good correlation with cancer mutation signatures
              attributed to smoking and other sources of guanine-directed base
              damage. CONCLUSION: This study provides support for the use of
              cell line mutagenesis assays to validate or predict the mutagenic
              effect of environmental and iatrogenic exposures. Our results
              suggest genetic reversion due to cisplatin-induced mutations as a
              distinct mechanism for developing resistance.",
