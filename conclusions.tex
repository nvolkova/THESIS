\section{Conclusions}

\subsection*{What is done}

Variability of mutational profiles across different DNA repair mutations

Prevalence of interaction effects between DNA repair components and damaging agents

Translation of studies in model organisms to human cancers

Limitations to signature analysis in cancers


\subsection*{What does it say}


\subsection*{What could also be done}


Significance for mutagenesis field: comprehensive catalogue of high-resolution profiles for a wide range of genetic knock-outs and mutagens

Significance for clinical research: bringing together whole-genome/exome profiling and targeted tests

Implications for diagnostics, treatment, resistance

Limitations: low signal in worm data, variance, high noise in human data, timing and clonality issues, technological limitations

Future work
